Resource-First Translations
=========================

RFT is the next generation Translation User eXperience built upon the insights
of the SharpDevelop project. It has the following goals:

* Code-First: Developers live in the IDE and work directly 
    with resource files. Source control is the source of truth for resources.
* Multi-Branch: Translations come and go with features being added, modified or removed.
    Translators should never duplicate work.
* Multi-File: Complex software doesn't ship with a single resource file only. Slice
    your application into modules and still get the benefits of translating only once.
* Sync: Automatically get the latest resource file checkins to the translators, and
    the finished translations to the developers or the build servers.
